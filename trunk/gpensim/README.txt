Version 0.1
==========


Introduction
----------

The DECS GPenSIM package contains MATLAB .m files which can be used together
with GPenSIM to simulating the Generic Distributed Exact Cover (DECS) system
using Petri nets.


Usage
----------

Download GPenSIM from www.davidrajuh.net/gpensim/ and install it. Then run the
decs_msf.m file from MATLAB and wait for the simulation results. 

Try to modify some of the parameters in the decs_msf.m file and see how it
affects the simulation results.
