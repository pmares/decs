This report details the implementation of a distributed computing system which can be used to solve exact cover problems.
This work is based on Donald E. Knuth's recursive Dancing Links algorithm which is designed to efficiently solve exact cover problems.
A variation of this algorithm is developed which enables the problems to be distributed to a global network of computers using the BOINC framework.
The parallel nature of this distributed computing platform allows more complex problems to be solved.
Exact cover problems includes, but is not limited to, $n$-queens, Latin Square puzzles, Sudoku, polyomino tiling, set packing and set partitioning.
The details of the modified Dancing Links algorithm and the implementation is explained in detail.
A Petri net model is developed to examine the flow of data in the distributed system by running a number of simulations.
