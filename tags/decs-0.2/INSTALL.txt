DECS Build Instructions
====================

Prerequisites
----------

- cmake 2.4 or later: www.cmake.org
- C++ compiler and linker
- A standard make program or an IDE which cmake supports


Instructions
----------

The most common way to compile and install DECS is by typing the following
commands in the source directory (the directory where you found this document):

cd build/
cmake .. -G <generator>
make
make install

Where <generator> is one of the available makefile generators for your platform.
You can see a list of all available generators by running the cmake command
without any parameters. For example if you have installed MinGW you can type:

cmake .. -G "MinGW Makefiles"

It's also possible to use a generator which creates project files for one of the
IDEs that cmake supports. In that case you don't need to run the make commands,
but instead open the project file in the IDE in order to build the program.

Several other options can be changed by modifying the CMakeCache.txt file. This
file appears after cmake has been successfully run once. cmake can be run in
interactive/wizard mode by passing it the -i option. You can use the interactive
mode in cmake or the ccmake command (curses interface) if available on your
system.


Installation Path
----------

To specify where the files should be installed use the -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX
option. For example if you want to install the program into
"D:\Private Files\Programs\decs" you type:

cmake .. -G <generator> -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX="D:\Private Files\Programs\decs"

You can also set this value in the CMakeCache.txt file. This file appears after
cmake has been successfully run once.


Windows
----------

On a standard Windows system cmake will ensure that all the DECS files are
installed in the "C:\Program Files\decs" directory.

If you want to use MinGW on Windows you might have to substitute the command
"make" with "mingw32-make" in the description above.
