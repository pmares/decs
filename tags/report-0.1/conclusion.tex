\section{Future work}

\subsection*{Sub-bit precision packing}

To make the file format explanation easy to understand the conventional bit packing technique was chosen over sub-bit precision packing.
With sub-bit precision packing we can achieve an even better file size reduction at the expense of a few more CPU cycles.
This is especially important for problems having very large DLX matrices.
By implementing this extension to the conventional technique we will increase the performance of the system.
