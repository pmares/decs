Dance Exact Cover Solver
Version 0.2
==========


Introduction
----------

The dance exact cover solver program uses libdlx to solve general exact cover
problems. libdlx in turn uses Donald E. Knuth's Dancing Links algorithm to solve
the exact cover problems provided by the dance program. The dance program is
part of the Generic Distributed Exact Cover Solver (DECS) suite.


Usage
----------

The dance program takes the path to a DECS file as a parameter.

dance.exe [options] <file.decs>

Try some of the example DECS files in the example directory.
